Overview
====================

**Best attempt** to get user's (client's) real ip-address while keeping it **DRY**.


Notice
====================

There is no good `out-of-the-box` solution against fake IP addresses, aka `IP Address Spoofing`.
You are encouraged to read the ([Advanced users](README.md#advanced-users)) section of this page and
set `IPWARE_TRUSTED_PROXY_LIST` to match your needs `if` you are planning to include `ipware` in any
authentication, security or `anti-fraud` related architecture.


How to install
====================

    1. easy_install django-ipware
    2. pip install django-ipware
    3. git clone http://github.com/un33k/django-ipware
        a. cd django-ipware
        b. run python setup.py install
    4. wget https://github.com/un33k/django-ipware/zipball/master
        a. unzip the downloaded file
        b. cd into django-ipware-* directory
        c. run python setup.py install


How to use
====================

   ```python
    # If your web server is publicly accessible on the Internet
    # =========================================================
    # To get the `real` IP address of the client.
    # Where:
    #    `Real IP` = an IP address that is route-able on the Internet

    from ipware.ip import get_real_ip
    ip = get_real_ip(request)
    if ip is not None:
       # we have a real, public ip address for user
    else:
       # we don't have a real, public ip address for user


    # If your web server is NOT publicly accessible on the Internet
    # =============================================================
    # To get the `best matched` IP address of the client.
    # Where:
    #    `Best Matched IP` = The first matched public IP if found, else the first matched non-public IP.

    from ipware.ip import get_ip
    ip = get_ip(request)
    if ip is not None:
       # we have an ip address for user
    else:
       # we don't have an ip address for user

    # By default the left most address in the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` is returned. However, depending on your
    # preference and needs, you can change this behavior by passing the `right_most_proxy=True` to the API.
    # Please note that not all proxies are equal. So left to right or right to left is not a rule that all
    # proxy servers follow.
    from ipware.ip import get_ip
    ip = get_ip(request, right_most_proxy=True)
    # OR
    ip = get_real_ip(request, right_most_proxy=True)
   ```


Advanced users:
====================

   ```python
    # you can provide your own meta precedence order by
    # including IPWARE_META_PRECEDENCE_ORDER in your project's
    # settings.py. The check is done from top to bottom
    IPWARE_META_PRECEDENCE_ORDER = (
        'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', 'X_FORWARDED_FOR',  # client, proxy1, proxy2
        'HTTP_CLIENT_IP',
        'HTTP_X_REAL_IP',
        'HTTP_X_FORWARDED',
        'HTTP_X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP',
        'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR',
        'HTTP_FORWARDED',
        'HTTP_VIA',
        'REMOTE_ADDR',
    )

    # you can provide your own private IP prefixes by
    # including IPWARE_PRIVATE_IP_PREFIX in your project's setting.py
    # IPs that start with items listed below are ignored
    # and are not considered a `real` IP address
    IPWARE_PRIVATE_IP_PREFIX = (
        '0.',  # externally non-routable
        '10.',  # class A private block
        '169.254.',  # link-local block
        '172.16.', '172.17.', '172.18.', '172.19.',
        '172.20.', '172.21.', '172.22.', '172.23.',
        '172.24.', '172.25.', '172.26.', '172.27.',
        '172.28.', '172.29.', '172.30.', '172.31.',  # class B private blocks
        '192.0.2.',  # reserved for documentation and example code
        '192.168.',  # class C private block
        '255.255.255.',  # IPv4 broadcast address
    ) + (
        '2001:db8:',  # reserved for documentation and example code
        'fc00:',  # IPv6 private block
        'fe80:',  # link-local unicast
        'ff00:',  # IPv6 multicast
    )

    # if you plan to use `ipware` in any authentication, security or `anti-fraud` related
    # architecture, you should configure it to only `trust` one or more `known` proxy server(s)).
    # simply include `IPWARE_TRUSTED_PROXY_LIST` in your project's settings.py
    IPWARE_TRUSTED_PROXY_LIST = ['23.91.45.15', '23.91.45.16']  # exact proxies
    # -- OR --
    IPWARE_TRUSTED_PROXY_LIST = ['23.91.45'] # any proxy within a specific subnet
    # alternatively, you may pass the `trusted` proxy list on demand on each call
    # example:  ip = get_trusted_ip(request, trusted_proxies=['23.91.45.15'])
   ```
